                The richest man in the world does not own a house and has recently been selling off his fortune. He
                tosses
                satellites
                into orbit and harnesses the sun; he drives a car he created that uses no gas and barely needs a driver.
                With a
                flick of
                his finger, the stock market soars or swoons. An army of devotees hangs on his every utterance. He
                dreams of
                Mars as he
                bestrides Earth, square-jawed and indomitable. Lately, Elon Musk also likes to live-tweet his poops.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Just dropping some friends off at the pool,” the 50-year-old zillionaire informed his 66 million
                Twitter
                followers on
                the evening of Nov. 29, having previously advised that at least half his tweets were “made on a
                porcelain
                throne.” After
                an interval—21 minutes, if you must know—an update: “Splish splash.”
                “Sometimes I do hit some resonant notes with respect to humor,” Musk says of his puerile expressions.
                It’s a
                warm, windy
                December day at Starbase, his new rocket-fabrication and launch facility at the southern tip of Texas.
                Two
                of
                his
                Starship rockets—gleaming, pointy-nosed, 160-ft. stainless-steel silos—are silhouetted behind him in the
                setting
                sun.
                “But you know, not all jokes land.”

                This is the man who aspires to save our planet and get us a new one to inhabit: clown, genius, edgelord,
                visionary,
                industrialist, showman, cad; a madcap hybrid of Thomas Edison, P.T. Barnum, Andrew Carnegie and
                Watchmen’s
                Doctor
                Manhattan, the brooding, blue-skinned man-god who invents electric cars and moves to Mars. His startup
                rocket
                company,
                SpaceX, has leapfrogged Boeing and others to own America’s spacefaring future. His car company, Tesla,
                controls
                two-thirds of the multibillion-dollar electric-vehicle market it pioneered and is valued at a cool $1
                trillion.
                That has
                made Musk, with a net worth of more than $250 billion, the richest private citizen in history, at least
                on
                paper. He’s a
                player in robots and solar, cryptocurrency and climate, brain-computer implants to stave off the menace
                of
                artificial
                intelligence and underground tunnels to move people and freight at super speeds. He dominates Wall
                Street:
                “The
                way
                finance works now is that things are valuable not based on their cash flows but on their proximity to
                Elon
                Musk,”
                Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine wrote in February, after Musk’s “Gamestonk!!” tweet vaulted the
                meme-stock
                craze
                into
                the stratosphere.

                Musk has spent a lifetime defying the haters; now, it seems, he’s finally in position to put them in
                their
                place. For
                2021 was the year of Elon Unbound. In April, SpaceX won NASA’s exclusive contract to put U.S. astronauts
                on
                the
                moon for
                the first time since 1972. In May, Musk hosted Saturday Night Live. In October, car-rental giant Hertz
                announced
                it
                planned to add 100,000 Teslas to its fleet. The juvenile missives from his unmistakably phallic Twitter
                avatar
                came days
                after one of his rockets launched NASA’s first antiasteroid planetary-defense test; a few weeks before
                another
                launched
                a first-of-its-kind mission to study cosmic X-rays; and amid Musk’s sale of 10% of his Tesla stock, a
                process
                that
                roiled markets, cost him billions and should produce enough tax revenue to fund the Commerce Department
                for
                a
                year. The
                sale was prompted by a Twitter poll Musk posted in a fit of pique over liberal Senators’ proposals to
                tax
                billionaires.

                Many people are described as larger than life, but few deserve it. How many of us truly exceed our life
                span?
                How many
                will make it into the digital textbooks our spacefaring descendants will study? As Shakespeare observed
                in
                Julius
                Caesar, it’s far easier to be remembered for doing evil than doing good. How many will leave a mark on
                the
                world—much
                less the universe—for their contributions rather than their crimes? A few short years ago, Musk was
                roundly
                mocked as a
                crazy con artist on the verge of going broke. Now this shy South African with Asperger’s syndrome, who
                escaped a
                brutal
                childhood and overcame personal tragedy, bends governments and industry to the force of his ambition.

                Musk at the Tesla Gigafactory in Grünheide, Germany, on oct. 9 Patrick Pleul—Picture-Alliance/DPA/AP
                To Musk, his vast fortune is a mere side effect of his ability not just to see but to do things others
                cannot,
                in arenas
                where the stakes are existential. “He was raised in a tough environment and born with a very special
                brain,”
                says
                Antonio Gracias, Musk’s close friend of two decades, who has held seats on the boards of Tesla and
                SpaceX.
                “Ninety-nine-point-nine percent of people in that situation don’t come out of it. Some small percentage
                come
                out
                of it
                with the ability he has to make great decisions under extraordinary pressure and the never-ending drive
                to
                change the
                course of humanity.”

            <p class="first-letter">
                Such cosmic ambition rarely comes without consequences, and Musk still must answer to earthly
                authorities.
                His
                companies
                have faced allegations of sexual harassment and poor working conditions; in October, a federal jury
                ordered
                Tesla to pay
                $137 million to a Black employee who accused the automaker of ignoring racial abuse. The businesses have
                also
                been fined
                for numerous regulatory violations. The feds are probing Tesla’s Autopilot software, which has been
                involved
                in
                an
                alarming number of crashes with parked emergency vehicles, resulting in injuries and death. The
                company’s
                expansion in
                China required cozying up to its repressive autocrats.

            <p class="first-letter">
                The toll his hard-driving style takes on staff is legendary. Former associates have described Musk as
                petty,
                cruel and
                petulant, particularly when frustrated or challenged. He recently separated from the experimental
                musician
                Grimes, the
                mother of his seventh son. “He is a savant when it comes to business, but his gift is not empathy with
                people,”
                says his
                brother and business partner Kimbal Musk. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he’s made statements downplaying
                the
                virus,
                broken local health regulations to keep his factories running and amplified skepticism about vaccine
                safety.
                Musk tells
                TIME he and his eligible children are vaccinated and that “the science is unequivocal,” but that he
                opposes
                vaccine
                mandates: “You are taking a risk, but people do risky things all the time,” he says of the unvaccinated.
                “I
                believe
                we’ve got to watch out for the erosion of freedom in America.” The vast expanse of human misery can seem
                an
                afterthought
                to a man with his eyes on Mars.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Musk is easily cast as a hubristic supervillain, lumped in with the tech bros and space playboys, for
                whom
                money
                is
                scorekeeping and rockets are the ultimate toy. But he’s different: he’s a manufacturing magnate—moving
                metal,
                not bytes.
                His rockets, built from scratch on an autodidact’s mold-breaking vision, have saved taxpayers billions,
                reinvigorated
                America’s space dreams and are launching satellites to expand Internet access across the globe. If Tesla
                delivers on its
                pledges, it has the potential to strike a major blow against global warming. The man from the future
                where
                technology
                makes all things possible is a throwback to our glorious industrial past, before America stagnated and
                stopped
                producing
                anything but rules, restrictions, limits, obstacles and Facebook.

                “He is a humanist—not in the sense of being a nice person, because he isn’t,” says Robert Zubrin,
                founder of
                the
                Mars
                Society, who met Musk in 2001, when the young, newly minted dot-com millionaire sent a large unsolicited
                check
                to the
                organization. “He wants eternal glory for doing great deeds, and he is an asset to the human race
                because he
                defines a
                great deed as something that is great for humanity. He is greedy for glory. Money to him is a means, not
                an
                end.
                Who
                today evaluates Thomas Edison on the basis of which of his inventions turned a profit?”
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                For all his outlier qualities, Musk also embodies the zeitgeist of this liminal age. This was the year
                we
                emerged from
                the hundred-year plague only to find there was no normal to go back to, a year that felt like the cusp
                of a
                brave or
                terrifying new world, with nobody in charge and everything up for renegotiation—from how we work and
                travel
                to
                what we
                find meaning in and cherish. Musk is our avatar of infinite possibility, our usher to the remade world,
                where
                shopworn
                practices are cast aside and the unprecedented becomes logical, where Earth and humanity can still be
                saved.
                Perhaps no
                one man should have all that power. Perhaps this vision of the greater good comes with a human cost. But
                if
                many
                never
                voted or signed up for Musk’s wild zero-gravity ride, that is of no consequence to him.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Musk ducks his large frame under the massive steel ring that holds the tallest, most powerful rocket
                ever
                designed and
                peers up at the dozens of engine nozzles that will power it. His fluffy little gray dog, Marvin, follows
                close
                behind
                the heels of his black cowboy boots, which Musk has paired with a black Tom Ford jacket and black jeans.
                His
                excited
                technical patter suddenly goes quiet; he sees something up in the gnarled mass of metal tubes that
                displeases
                him. “If
                one engine catches fire,” he explains, “we want to ensure that fire does not spread through the entire
                volume.”
                There
                are barriers between the engines for this purpose, but he’s not convinced they’re sufficient.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Musk has a soft handshake and an even voice that expresses exasperation, joy and breathtaking ambition
                in
                the
                same quiet
                register. Tesla may be the principal source of his stupendous wealth and fame, as well as his greatest
                impact on
                the
                planet to date. But it is space that animates his wildest, most extreme ambitions. Musk’s toddler, X Æ
                A-Xii
                (pronounced
                “X”), has recently started saying car, to which his father responds, “Rocket!”

                “The goal overall has been to make life multi-planetary and enable humanity to become a spacefaring
                civilization,” Musk
                says—not because it would be profitable, but because it would be “exciting,” at least to him. “And the
                next
                really big
                thing is to build a self-sustaining city on Mars and bring the animals and creatures of Earth there.
                Sort of
                like a
                futuristic Noah’s ark. We’ll bring more than two, though—it’s a little weird if there’s only two.”
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                How Musk can believe something so improbable is easier to understand when you learn just how unlikely
                his
                current
                spacefaring success has been. Before it was America’s passport to the solar system, SpaceX nearly
                bankrupted
                Musk. Its
                first rocket, the Falcon, failed three times before reaching orbit in 2008. The company proceeded to
                create
                the
                Falcon 9
                and then the Falcon Heavy, which has three clusters of nine engines. Clustering engines was previously
                considered a bad
                idea because of the number of moving parts that can go explosively wrong—one of many assumptions Musk
                upended.
                “When I
                first looked at the clustering of engines on the Falcon 9, I had to roll my eyes,” says Scott Pace,
                director
                of
                George
                Washington University’s Space Policy Institute. “But that’s why Elon Musk is smarter than me.”

                the
                sea.
                “No one
                has ever made a fully reusable orbital rocket of any kind whatsoever,” Musk says. “We just live on a
                planet
                where this
                is an extremely difficult job.” He describes the challenge with evident relish. “It’s like, if this was
                a
                video
                game,
                the setting is on maximum but not impossible.” In the past six years, SpaceX has successfully landed the
                first
                stage of
                90 of its Falcon 9 rockets and reflown 72 of them. Musk has yet to achieve full reusability by reflying
                both
                rocket
                stages.

            <p class="first-letter">
                Before Musk, America’s space industry was moribund. In 2011, NASA mothballed the last space shuttle,
                after
                inking a deal
                with SpaceX to make uncrewed cargo resupply runs to the International Space Station (ISS). SpaceX made
                its
                first
                such
                trip in 2012, two years ahead of the competition, and in 2014, NASA tapped the company and behemoth
                Boeing
                to
                fly crews
                to the ISS. SpaceX launched its first crew to the ISS aboard a Dragon spacecraft in May 2020. Boeing,
                delayed by
                development problems, is not planning even an uncrewed test flight until next year.

                For the Dragon, Musk swept away old-school instrument panels and replaced them with three oversize touch
                screens.

            <p class="first-letter">
                here’s no control stick; the spacecraft’s attitude, orbit and re-entry engines are all governed by the
                screens.
                Astronaut Doug Hurley, commander of the first crewed Dragon flight, worried the screens would delay
                reaction
                times, but
                SpaceX solved this by making Dragon an automated ship. “There’s no plans to do any more manual flying,
                certainly
                on the
                NASA missions,” Hurley says, “unless there’s a need for it from a systems failure kind of scenario.”
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Success has not dampened Musk’s appetite for risk. After being lofted into space by a Falcon Super
                Heavy,
                his
                next
                rocket, the Starship, will light out for the moon, land there, take off and return to Earth, with no
                stages
                expended on
                the lunar journey. This so-called single-stage-to-orbit model has been the white whale of rocket
                designers
                for
                generations. In test flights, four prototype Starships exploded on landing before a successful test last
                May.
                For NASA
                and most private aerospace companies, a single crash is a setback that can take years to recover from.
                SpaceX
                works more
                like a Silicon Valley startup, where the goal is to fail quickly and iterate. This gets expensive fast.
                Over
                Thanksgiving, Musk emailed employees that Starship’s new Raptor engine was facing a “production crisis”
                that
                could
                bankrupt SpaceX if it did not achieve a “Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next
                year.”
                In a
                “worst-case situation,” he tells TIME, “bankruptcy is not out of the question, not that it’s likely.”
                The
                point,
                he
                says, was to remind staff that “we cannot lose our edge or get complacent.”

                With its Starlink program, SpaceX hopes to launch a constellation of as many as 42,000 satellites to
                provide
                Internet
                service to the world. But that kind of orbiting swarm wreaks havoc on sky gazing. “Just how much stuff

                you
                want to

                astronomers
                are
                appropriately making noise about interfering with their ability to observe.” (Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX’s
                president, tells
                TIME the company is working on the problem.)

            <p class="first-letter">
                In April, NASA selected SpaceX to build the lunar lander for the Artemis program, thanks in part to a
                lowball
                $2.9
                billion bid. A bid by Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin came in at more than twice that. Bezos sued, accusing Musk
                of
                undercutting
                the competition. Musk took the opportunity to rub his victory in the face of the world’s second richest
                man:
                “If
                lobbying & lawyers could get u to orbit, Bezos would be on Pluto,” he tweeted. In November, the federal
                claims
                court
                ruled in Musk’s favor.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Sometime in the next month or two, Musk hopes to launch the Starship into orbit for the first time,
                powered
                by
                33
                engines at the base of an enormous, 230-ft. steel tube containing nearly 7.5 million lb. of supercooled
                liquid
                fuel. “I
                think we can do a loop around the moon maybe as soon as 2023,” he says, and land on the moon’s surface
                within
                three
                years.

                SpaceX is a private company, so whether it’s profitable is not publicly known. (Note: TIME’s co-owners,
                Marc
                and
                Lynne
                Benioff, have invested in companies connected to space exploration, including SpaceX. They have no
                involvement
                in TIME’s
                editorial decisions.) But that’s not the point, Musk says. One day, he hopes, the rockets will carry 100
                people
                at a
                time to Mars, where the ships can be refilled with fuel manufactured on the Red Planet and shuttled back
                to
                Earth. Asked
                when he sees this happening, Musk pauses for a long moment, as if calculating all the variables—federal
                regulations and
                production schedules, test-flight targets and bathroom requirements. “I’ll be surprised if we’re not
                landing
                on
                Mars
                within five years,” he finally says.

                What will humans do there, and for how long? We have had little use for the moon since landing there 50
                years
                ago. Musk
                argues that interplanetary life is the next great leap of evolution, like the emergence of multicellular
                organisms, and
                also that Mars could provide a home for humanity if Earth becomes uninhabitable. Experts aren’t so sure.
                “I

                Musk is not deterred. Gamboling around the concrete slab littered with massive machines of his own

                Musk
                acknowledges his latest rocket could go the way of his first three. “I wouldn’t say that our odds of
                getting
                to
                orbit

                over
                his shoulder; cell phones here pick up signals from Mexico, a stone’s throw away. How does it feel to

                about the
                most powerful- rocket ever built exploding in a billion-dollar fireball? “Pretty scary!” he says,

            <p class="first-letter">
                Then the tour is over. Musk turns, whistles to Marvin and strides briskly to his waiting Tesla.

                Electric cars, like homemade rockets, were a graveyard of well-intentioned investment before Musk
                barreled
                into
                an
                industry in which he had no academic training. For decades, legacy automakers had stymied the
                development of
                electric
                vehicles, lobbying against fuel-efficiency standards and filing lawsuits against state mandates to
                develop
                the
                cars.
                Tesla’s business was sustained in part by generous support from the federal government, though the
                company
                got
                off the
                ground before it became available. A $465 million federal loan in 2010 helped prop up Tesla at a crucial
                juncture, and
                its customers have benefitted from hefty tax incentives.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Musk believed from the start that advances in lithium-ion battery technology made long-range electric
                vehicles
                possible.
                In practice, it wasn’t that easy. Tesla’s first decade was plagued by unmet deadlines, technical snafus
                and
                cost
                overruns. During the 2008 financial crisis, cash was so tight the company came within days of missing
                payroll.
                With a
                dwindling fortune, Musk borrowed $20 million from SpaceX to loan the company, cajoled another $20
                million
                out of
                investors and raised the price of the company’s debut sports car to survive.

                Tesla went public in 2010, but for years it remained in crisis mode. With production behind schedule,
                and
                the
                company at
                risk of running out of money, Musk spent much of April 2018 sleeping on the factory floor as he tried to
                iron
                out
                assembly-line issues. “He would wake up, look at the monitors on the wall and go chase the constraint,”
                says
                Musk’s
                adviser Omead Afshar, who slept on a cot. “He would be in there reviewing the system, redoing the code
                himself,
                solving
                problems, bouncing from station to station. He will endure the most pain to lead by example, and all of
                us
                around him
                really can’t complain when we’re not working that hard.” For Musk’s 47th birthday that June, he briefly
                paused
                for a
                bite of grocery-store cake, then went back to the paint-shop tunnel.

            <p class="first-letter">
                The cars finally rolled off the line, but soon enough, Musk shot himself in the foot. In August 2018, he
                tweeted
                that he
                had funding to take the company private for $420 a share. The Securities and Exchange Commission sued
                him,
                alleging he
                had committed securities fraud. The resulting settlement cost him his perch as Tesla’s board chair,
                though
                he
                was able
                to retain the title of CEO. The adult supervision extends only to a point. Three months later, Tesla
                sent a
                software
                update that enabled the car to make farting noises on command. (“Please put ‘invented car fart’ on my
                gravestone,” Musk
                tweeted.) But for all the immaturity, his public profile has an upside as well. “We don’t spend any
                money on
                advertising,” notes Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm. “His ability to communicate with a very wide range
                of
                people
                globally through social media, I think, has been a huge asset to the company—you know, by and large.”
                His
                longtime
                friend Bill Lee, who finds his memes and trolling “charming,” says he was the one who persuaded Musk to
                join
                Twitter. “I
                remember when he had zero followers,” Lee recalls. “He’s probably the most viral social influencer
                ever.”

                Today, thanks in large part to Musk’s pace-setting, auto companies from VW to Nissan are jostling to
                invest
                billions in
                electric vehicles. Their about-face is driven less by altruism than by a dawning realization that Musk
                is
                eating
                their
                lunch. “Musk and Tesla forced the change,” says Michelle Krebs, an analyst at Cox Automotive. “He proved
                that
                there was
                a market for EVs.”
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                That has made Musk arguably the biggest private contributor to the fight against climate change. Had the
                800,000
                Teslas
                sold in the last year been gas-powered cars, they would have emitted more than 40 million metric tons of
                CO₂
                over their
                lifetimes—equivalent to the annual emissions of Finland. But EVs may ultimately be less important to the
                climate
                fight
                than the central innovation that made them possible: batteries. Tesla has repurposed the lightweight,
                energy-dense cells
                that power its cars for huge grid-scale batteries that provide essential backup for renewables. Demand
                for
                Tesla’s
                smaller home-based Powerwall, which can store electricity from rooftop solar systems, has spiked as
                consumers
                look for
                alternatives to the grid, driven by everything from February’s Texas power shortage to the fire risk in
                California that
                has led to power shutoffs. In some areas, software enables utilities to tap into home-energy reserves
                when
                the
                grid is
                strained, instead of turning on high-polluting standby generators. Gerry Hawkes, a 72-year-old forester
                from
                Woodstock,
                Vt., has been participating in one such program since 2017, allowing his local utility to draw power
                from a
                pair
                of
                Tesla backup batteries in his basement. “It makes sense for power backup, and it makes sense for climate
