                    In recent years the mushrooming power, functionality and ubiquity of computers and the Internet have
                    outstripped
                    early
                    forecasts about technology’s rate of advancement and usefulness in everyday life. Alert pundits now
                    foresee
                    a
                    world
                    saturated with powerful computer chips, which will increasingly insinuate themselves into our
                    gadgets,
                    dwellings,
                    apparel and even our bodies.

                    Yet a closely related goal has remained stubbornly elusive. In stark contrast to the largely
                    unanticipated
                    explosion of
                    computers into the mainstream, the entire endeavor of robotics has failed rather completely to live
                    up
                    to
                    the
                    predictions of the 1950s. In those days experts who were dazzled by the seemingly miraculous
                    calculational
                    ability of
                    computers thought that if only the right software were written, computers could become the articial
                    brains
                    of
                    sophisticated autonomous robots. Within a decade or two, they believed, such robots would be
                    cleaning
                    our
                    oors,
                    mowing
                    our lawns and, in general, eliminating drudgery from our lives.

                    Obviously, it hasn’t turned out that way. It is true that industrial robots have transformed the
                    manufacture
                    of
                    automobiles, among other products. But that kind of automation is a far cry from the versatile,
                    mobile,
                    autonomous
                    creations that so many scientists and engineers have hoped for. In pursuit of such robots, waves of
                    researchers
                    have
                    grown disheartened and scores of start-up companies have gone out of business.

                    It is not the mechanical “body” that is unattainable; articulated arms and other moving mechanisms
                    adequate
                    for
                    manual
                    work already exist, as the industrial robots attest. Rather it is the computer-based articial brain
                    that
                    is
                    still well
                    below the level of sophistication needed to build a humanlike robot.

                <p class="first-letter">
                    Nevertheless, I am convinced that the decades-old dream of a useful, general-purpose autonomous
                    robot
                    will
                    be
                    realized
                    in the not too distant future. By 2010 we will see mobile robots as big as people but with cognitive
                    abilities
                    similar
                    in many respects to those of a lizard. The machines will be capable of carrying out simple chores,
                    such
                    as
                    vacuuming,
                    dusting, delivering packages and taking out the garbage. By 2040, I believe, we will nally achieve
                    the
                    original
                    goal of
                    robotics and a thematic mainstay of science ction: a freely moving machine with the intellectual
                    capabilities of
                    a human
                    being.

                    In light of what I have just described as a history of largely unfullled goals in robotics, why do I
                    believe
                    that rapid
                    progress and stunning accomplishments are in the ofng? My condence is based on recent developments
                    in
                    electronics and
                    software, as well as on my own observations of robots, computers and even insects, reptiles and
                    other
                    living
                    things over
                    the past 30 years.

                <p class="first-letter">
                    The single best reason for optimism is the soaring performance in recent years of mass-produced
                    computers.
                    Through the
                    1970s and 1980s, the computers readily available to robotics researchers were capable of executing
                    about
                    one
                    million
                    instructions per second (MIPS). Each of these instructions represented a very basic task, like
                    adding
                    two
                    10-digit
                    numbers or storing the result in a specied location in memory.
                </p>

                <p class="first-letter">
                    In the 1990s computer power suitable for controlling a research robot shot through 10 MIPS, 100 MIPS
                    and
                    has
                    lately
                    reached 50,000 MIPS in a few high-end desktop computers with multiple processors. Apple’s MacBook
                    laptop
                    computer, with
                    a retail price at the time of this writing of $1,099, achieves about 10,000 MIPS. Thus, functions
                    far
                    beyond
                    the
                    capabilities of robots in the 1970s and 1980s are now coming close to commercial viability.

                    For example, in October 1995 an experimental vehicle called Navlab V crossed the U.S. from
                    Washington,
                    D.C.,
                    to
                    San
                    Diego, driving itself more than 95 percent of the time. The vehicle’s self-driving and navigational
                    system
                    was
                    built
                    around a 25-MIPS laptop based on a microprocessor by Sun Microsystems. The Navlab V was built by the
                    Robotics
                    Institute
                    at Carnegie Mellon University, of which I am a member. Similar robotic vehicles, built by
                    researchers
                    elsewhere
                    in the
                    U.S. and in Germany, have logged thousands of highway kilometers under all kinds of weather and
                    driving
                    con­ditions.
                    Dramatic progress in this field became evident in the DARPA Grand Challenge contests held in
                    California.
                    In
                    October 2005
                    several fully autonomous cars successfully traversed a hazard-studded 132-mile desert course, and in
                    2007
                    several
                    successfully drove for half a day in urban traffic ­conditions.

                <p class="first-letter">
                    In other experiments within the past few years, mobile robots mapped and navigated unfamiliar ofce
                    suites,
                    and
                    computer
                    vision systems located textured objects and tracked and analyzed faces in real time. Meanwhile
                    personal
                    com­puters
                    became much more adept at recognizing text and speech.

                <p class="first-letter">Still, computers are no match today for humans in such functions as recognition
                    and navigation. This
                    puzzled
                    experts for
                    many years, because computers are far superior to us in calculation. The explanation of this
                    apparent
                    paradox
                    follows
                    from the fact that the human brain, in its entirety, is not a true programmable, general-purpose
                    computer
                    (what
                    computer
                    scientists refer to as a universal machine; almost all computers nowadays are examples of such
                    machines).

                <p class="first-letter">
                    To understand why this is requires an evolutionary perspective. To survive, our early ancestors had
                    to
                    do
                    several things
                    repeatedly and very well: locate food, escape predators, mate and protect offspring. Those tasks
                    depended
                    strongly on
                    the brain’s ability to recognize and navigate. Honed by hundreds of millions of years of evolution,
                    the
                    brain
                    became a
                    kind of ultrasophisticated—but special-­purpose—computer.

                    The ability to do mathematical calculations, of course, was irrelevant for survival. Nevertheless,
                    as
                    language
                    trans­formed human culture, at least a small part of our brains evolved into a universal machine of
                    sorts.
                    One
                    of the
                    hallmarks of such a machine is its ability to follow an arbitrary set of instructions, and with
                    language,
                    such
                    instructions could be transmitted and carried out. But because we visualize numbers as complex
                    shapes,
                    write
                    them down
                    and perform other such functions, we process digits in a monumentally awkward and inefcient way. We
                    use
                    hundreds
                    of
                    billions of neurons to do in minutes what hundreds of them, specially “rewired” and arranged for
                    calculation,
                    could do
                    in milliseconds.

                    not so amazing: they calculate at a rate perhaps 100 times that of the average person. Computers, by

                    Molecular biology and neuroscience are steadily uncovering the physical mechanisms underlying life

                    so far
                    have addressed mainly the simpler mechanisms. Evidence that simple functions can be composed to
                    produce
                    the
                    higher
                    capabilities of nervous systems comes from programs that read, recognize speech, guide robot arms to
                    assemble
                    tight
                    components by feel, classify chemicals by articial smell and taste, reason about abstract matters,
                    and
                    so
                    on. Of
                    course,
                    computers and robots today fall far short of broad human or even animal competence. But that
                    situation
                    is
                    understandable
                    in light of an analysis, summarized in the next section, that concludes that today’s computers are
                    only
                    powerful
                    enough
                    to function like insect nervous systems. And, in my experience, robots do indeed perform like
                    insects on
                    simple
                    tasks.

                    If we accept that computers will eventually become powerful enough to simulate the mind, the
                    question

                    naturally
                    arises is: What processing rate will be necessary to yield performance on a par with the human
                    brain? To
                    explore
                    this
                    issue, I have considered the capabilities of the vertebrate retina, which is understood well enough
                    to
                    serve
                    as
                    a

                    circuits
                    in
                    the

                    similar
                    work, I believe it is possible to at least coarsely estimate the information-processing power of
                    nervous
                    tissue—and by
                    extrapolation, that of the entire human nervous system.

                    The human retina is a patch of nervous tissue in the back of the eyeball half a millimeter thick and
                    approximately two
                    centimeters across. It consists mostly of light-sensing cells, but one tenth of a millimeter of its
                    thickness is
                    populated by image-processing circuitry that is capable of detecting edges (boundaries between light

                    dark)
                    and

                    and each performs about 10 detections of an edge or a motion each second. The results ow deeper into
                    the

                    From long experience working on robot vision systems, I know that similar edge or motion detection,

                    by
                    efcient software, requires the execution of at least 100 computer instructions. Therefore, to
                    accomplish

                    retina’s 10
                    million detections per second would necessitate at least 1,000 MIPS.

                    The entire human brain is about 75,000 times heavier than the 0.02 gram of processing circuitry in
                    the
                    retina,
                    which
                    implies that it would take, in round numbers, 100 million MIPS (100 trillion instructions per

                    the

                    guppy,

                    cost and

                    My efforts are in the race. In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon we devised a way to distill large
                    amounts of
                    noisy
                    sensor
                    data into reliable maps by accumulating statistical evidence of emptiness or occupancy in each cell
                    of a
                    grid
                    representing the surroundings. The approach worked well in two dimensions and still guides many of
                    the
                    robots
                    described
                    above.

                    Three-dimensional maps, 1,000 times richer, promised to be much better but for years seemed
                    computationally
                    out
                    of
                    reach. In 1992 we used economies of scale and other tricks to reduce the computational costs of
                    three-dimensional maps
                    100-fold. Continued research led us to found a company, Seegrid, that sold its first dozen robots by
                    late
                    2007.
                    These
                    are load-pulling warehouse and factory “tugger” robots that, on command, autonomously follow routes
                    learned
                    in a
                    single
                    human-guided walk-through. They navigate by three-dimensionally grid-mapping their route, as seen
                    through
                    four
                    wide-angle stereoscopic cameras mounted on a “head,” and require no guide wires or other
                    navigational
                    markers.

                    Plans are afoot to improve, extend and miniaturize our techniques so that they can be used in other

                    run a powerful vacuum motor, and also would be able to frequently empty its dust load into a larger

                    explicitly
                    covered in their application programs. Unable to adapt to changing circumstances, they will often

                    inefciently or
                    not at all. Still, so much physical work awaits them in businesses, streets, elds and homes that

                    A second generation of universal robot with a mouselike 100,000 MIPS will adapt as the rst

                    modules” that
                    would generate positive and negative reinforcement signals in pre­de­ned circumstances. For example,
                    doing

                    fast and

                    There
                    will
                    be

                    overhand) to
                    the broadly general (work indoors or outdoors). As jobs are repeated, alternatives that result in
                    positive
                    reinforcement
