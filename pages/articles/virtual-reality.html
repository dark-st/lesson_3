            <p class="first-letter">
                The recent appearance of low cost virtual reality (VR) technologies – like the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive
                and
                the
                Sony
                PlayStation VR – and Mixed Reality Interfaces (MRITF) – like the Hololens – is attracting the attention
                of
                users
                and
                researchers suggesting it may be the next largest stepping stone in technological innovation. However,
                the
                history of VR
                technology is longer than it may seem: the concept of VR was formulated in the 1960s and the first
                commercial VR
                tools
                appeared in the late 1980s. For this reason, during the last 20 years, 100s of researchers explored the
                processes,
                effects, and applications of this technology producing 1000s of scientific papers. What is the outcome
                of
                this
                significant research work? This paper wants to provide an answer to this question by exploring, using
                advanced
                scientometric techniques, the existing research corpus in the field. We collected all the existent
                articles
                about VR in
                the Web of Science Core Collection scientific database, and the resultant dataset contained 21,667
                records
                for
                VR and
                9,944 for augmented reality (AR). The bibliographic record contained various fields, such as author,
                title,
                abstract,
                country, and all the references (needed for the citation analysis). The network and cluster analysis of
                the
                literature
                showed a composite panorama characterized by changes and evolutions over the time. Indeed, whether until
                5
                years
                ago,
                the main publication media on VR concerned both conference proceeding and journals, more recently
                journals
                constitute
                the main medium of communication.

                Similarly, if at first computer science was the leading research field,
                nowadays
                clinical areas have increased, as well as the number of countries involved in VR research. The present
                work
                discusses
                the evolution and changes over the time of the use of VR in the main areas of application with an
                emphasis
                on
                the future
                expected VR’s capacities, increases and challenges. We conclude considering the disruptive contribution
                that
                VR/AR/MRITF
                will be able to get in scientific fields, as well in human communication and interaction, as already
                happened
                with the
                advent of mobile phones by increasing the use and the development of scientific applications (e.g., in
                clinical
                areas)
                and by modifying the social communication and interaction among people.

                In the last 5 years, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have attracted the interest of
                investors
                and the
                general public, especially after Mark Zuckerberg bought Oculus for two billion dollars (Luckerson, 2014;
                Castelvecchi,
                2016). Currently, many other companies, such as Sony, Samsung, HTC, and Google are making huge
                investments
                in VR
                and AR
                (Korolov, 2014; Ebert, 2015; Castelvecchi, 2016). However, if VR has been used in research for more than
                25
                years, and
                now there are 1000s of papers and many researchers in the field, comprising a strong, interdisciplinary
                community, AR
                has a more recent application history (Burdea and Coiffet, 2003; Kim, 2005; Bohil et al., 2011; Cipresso
                and
                Serino,
                2014; Wexelblat, 2014). The study of VR was initiated in the computer graphics field and has been
                extended
                to
                several
                disciplines (Sutherland, 1965, 1968; Mazuryk and Gervautz, 1996; Choi et al., 2015). Currently,
                videogames
                supported by
                VR tools are more popular than the past, and they represent valuables, work-related tools for
                neuroscientists,
                psychologists, biologists, and other researchers as well.

                Indeed, for example, one of the main research purposes
                lies
                from navigation studies that include complex experiments that could be done in a laboratory by using VR,
                whereas,
                without VR, the researchers would have to go directly into the field, possibly with limited use of
                intervention.
                The
                importance of navigation studies for the functional understanding of human memory in dementia has been a
                topic
                of
                significant interest for a long time, and, in 2014, the Nobel Prize in “Physiology or Medicine” was
                awarded
                to
                John M.
                O’Keefe, May-Britt Moser, and Edvard I. Moser for their discoveries of nerve cells in the brain that
                enable
                a
                sense of
                place and navigation. Journals and magazines have extended this knowledge by writing about “the brain
                GPS,”
                which gives
                a clear idea of the mechanism. A huge number of studies have been conducted in clinical settings by
                using VR
                (Bohil et
                al., 2011; Serino et al., 2014), and Nobel Prize winner, Edvard I. Moser commented about the use of VR
                (Minderer
                et al.,
                2016), highlighting its importance for research and clinical practice. Moreover, the availability of
                free
                tools
                for VR
                experimental and computational use has made it easy to access any field (Riva et al., 2011; Cipresso,
                2015;
                Brown and
                Green, 2016; Cipresso et al., 2016).

                Augmented reality is a more recent technology than VR and shows an interdisciplinary application
                framework,
                in
                which,
                nowadays, education and learning seem to be the most field of research. Indeed, AR allows supporting
                learning,
                for
                example increasing-on content understanding and memory preservation, as well as on learning motivation.
                However,
                if VR
                benefits from clear and more definite fields of application and research areas, AR is still emerging in
                the
                scientific
                scenarios.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                In this article, we present a systematic and computational analysis of the emerging interdisciplinary VR
                and
                AR
                fields
                in terms of various co-citation networks in order to explore the evolution of the intellectual structure
                of
                this
                knowledge domain over time.

                The concept of VR could be traced at the mid of 1960 when Ivan Sutherland in a pivotal manuscript
                attempted
                to
                describe
                VR as a window through which a user perceives the virtual world as if looked, felt, sounded real and in
                which
                the user
                could act realistically (Sutherland, 1965).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Since that time and in accordance with the application area, several definitions have been formulated:
                for
                example,
                Fuchs and Bishop (1992) defined VR as “real-time interactive graphics with 3D models, combined with a
                display
                technology
                that gives the user the immersion in the model world and direct manipulation” (Fuchs and Bishop, 1992);
                Gigante
                (1993)
                described VR as “The illusion of participation in a synthetic environment rather than external
                observation
                of
                such an
                environment. VR relies on a 3D, stereoscopic head-tracker displays, hand/body tracking and binaural
                sound.
                VR is
                an
                immersive, multi-sensory experience” (Gigante, 1993); and “Virtual reality refers to immersive,
                interactive,
                multi-sensory, viewer-centered, 3D computer generated environments and the combination of technologies
                required
                building
                environments” (Cruz-Neira, 1993).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                As we can notice, these definitions, although different, highlight three common features of VR systems:
                immersion,
                perception to be present in an environment, and interaction with that environment (Biocca, 1997; Lombard
                and
                Ditton,
                1997; Loomis et al., 1999; Heeter, 2000; Biocca et al., 2001; Bailenson et al., 2006; Skalski and
                Tamborini,
                2007;
                Andersen and Thorpe, 2009; Slater, 2009; Sundar et al., 2010). Specifically, immersion concerns the
                amount
                of
                senses
                stimulated, interactions, and the reality’s similarity of the stimuli used to simulate environments.
                This
                feature can
                depend on the properties of the technological system used to isolate user from reality (Slater, 2009).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Finally, the user’s VR experience could be disclosed by measuring presence, realism, and reality’s
                levels.
                Presence is a
                complex psychological feeling of “being there” in VR that involves the sensation and perception of
                physical
                presence, as
                well as the possibility to interact and react as if the user was in the real world (Heeter, 1992).
                Similarly,
                the
                realism’s level corresponds to the degree of expectation that the user has about of the stimuli and
                experience
                (Baños et
                al., 2000, 2009). If the presented stimuli are similar to reality, VR user’s expectation will be
                congruent
                with
                reality
                expectation, enhancing VR experience. In the same way, higher is the degree of reality in interaction
                with
                the
                virtual
                stimuli, higher would be the level of realism of the user’s behaviors (Baños et al., 2000, 2009).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Looking chronologically on VR and AR developments, we can trace the first 3D immersive simulator in
                1962,
                when
                Morton
                Heilig created Sensorama, a simulated experience of a motorcycle running through Brooklyn characterized
                by
                several
                sensory impressions, such as audio, olfactory, and haptic stimuli, including also wind to provide a
                realist
                experience
                (Heilig, 1962). In the same years, Ivan Sutherland developed The Ultimate Display that, more than sound,
                smell,
                and
                haptic feedback, included interactive graphics that Sensorama didn’t provide. Furthermore, Philco
                developed
                the
                first
                HMD that together with The Sword of Damocles of Sutherland was able to update the virtual images by
                tracking
                user’s head
            </p>
            position and orientation (Sutherland, 1965).

            <p class="first-letter">
                In the 70s, the University of North Carolina realized GROPE, the
                first
                system of force-feedback and Myron Krueger created VIDEOPLACE an Artificial Reality in which the users’
                body
                figures
                were captured by cameras and projected on a screen (Krueger et al., 1985). In this way two or more users
                could
                interact
                in the 2D-virtual space. In 1982, the US’ Air Force created the first flight simulator [Visually Coupled
                Airbone
                System
                Simulator (VCASS)] in which the pilot through an HMD could control the pathway and the targets.
                Generally,
                the
                80’s were
                the years in which the first commercial devices began to emerge: for example, in 1985 the VPL company
                commercialized the
                DataGlove, glove sensors’ equipped able to measure the flexion of fingers, orientation and position, and
                identify hand
                gestures.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Another example is the Eyephone, created in 1988 by the VPL Company, an HMD system for completely
                immerging
                the user in a virtual world. At the end of 80’s, Fake Space Labs created a Binocular-Omni-Orientational
                Monitor
                (BOOM),
                a complex system composed by a stereoscopic-displaying device, providing a moving and broad virtual
                environment,
                and a
                mechanical arm tracking. Furthermore, BOOM offered a more stable image and giving more quickly responses
                to
                movements
                than the HMD devices. Thanks to BOOM and DataGlove, the NASA Ames Research Center developed the Virtual
                Wind
                Tunnel in
                order to research and manipulate airflow in a virtual airplane or space ship. In 1992, the Electronic
                Visualization
                Laboratory of the University of Illinois created the CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment, an immersive VR
                system
                composed
                by projectors directed on three or more walls of a room.

                More recently, many videogames companies have improved the development and quality of VR devices, like
                Oculus
                Rift, or
                HTC Vive that provide a wider field of view and lower latency. In addition, the actual HMD’s devices can
                be
                now
                combined
                with other tracker system as eye-tracking systems (FOVE), and motion and orientation sensors (e.g.,

                Simultaneously, at the beginning of 90’, the Boing Corporation created the first prototype of AR system
                for
                showing to
                employees how set up a wiring tool (Carmigniani et al., 2011). At the same time, Rosenberg and Feiner
                developed
                an AR
                fixture for maintenance assistance, showing that the operator performance enhanced by added virtual
                information
                on the
                fixture to repair (Rosenberg, 1993). In 1993 Loomis and colleagues produced an AR GPS-based system for
                helping
                the blind
                in the assisted navigation through adding spatial audio information (Loomis et al., 1998). Always in the
                1993
                Julie
                Martin developed “Dancing in Cyberspace,” an AR theater in which actors interacted with virtual object

                real
                time

                Few years later, Feiner et al. (1997) developed the first Mobile AR System (MARS) able to add
                virtual
                information about touristic buildings (Feiner et al., 1997). Since then, several applications have been
                developed: in
                Thomas et al. (2000), created ARQuake, a mobile AR video game; in 2008 was created Wikitude that through
                the
                mobile
                camera, internet, and GPS could add information about the user’s environments (Perry, 2008). In 2009
                others
                AR
                applications, like AR Toolkit and SiteLens have been developed in order to add virtual information to
                the
                physical
                user’s surroundings. In 2011, Total Immersion developed D’Fusion, and AR system for designing projects
                (Maurugeon,
                2011). Finally, in 2013 and 2015, Google developed Google Glass and Google HoloLens, and their usability
                have
                begun to
                test in several field of application.

                Technologically, the devices used in the virtual environments play an important role in the creation of
                successful
                virtual experiences. According to the literature, can be distinguished input and output devices (Burdea
                et
                al.,
                1996;
                Burdea and Coiffet, 2003). Input devices are the ones that allow the user to communicate with the
                virtual
                environment,
                which can range from a simple joystick or keyboard to a glove allowing capturing finger movements or a
                tracker
                able to
                capture postures. More in detail, keyboard, mouse, trackball, and joystick represent the desktop input
                devices
                easy to
                use, which allow the user to launch continuous and discrete commands or movements to the environment.
                Other
                input
                devices can be represented by tracking devices as bend-sensing gloves that capture hand movements,
                postures
                and
                gestures, or pinch gloves that detect the fingers movements, and trackers able to follow the user’s
                movements in
                the
                physical world and translate them in the virtual environment.
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                On the contrary, the output devices allow the user to see, hear, smell, or touch everything that happens
                in
                the
                virtual
                environment. As mentioned above, among the visual devices can be found a wide range of possibilities,
                from
                the
                simplest
                or least immersive (monitor of a computer) to the most immersive one such as VR glasses or helmets or
                HMD or
                CAVE
                systems.

                Furthermore, auditory, speakers, as well as haptic output devices are able to stimulate body senses
                providing a
                more
                real virtual experience. For example, haptic devices can stimulate the touch feeling and force models in
                the
                user.

                Since its appearance, VR has been used in different fields, as for gaming (Zyda, 2005; Meldrum et al.,
                2012),
                military
                training (Alexander et al., 2017), architectural design (Song et al., 2017), education (Englund et al.,
                2017),
                learning
                and social skills training (Schmidt et al., 2017), simulations of surgical procedures (Gallagher et al.,
                2005),
                assistance to the elderly or psychological treatments are other fields in which VR is bursting strongly
                (Freeman
                et al.,
                2017; Neri et al., 2017). A recent and extensive review of Slater and Sanchez-Vives (2016) reported the
                main
                VR
                application evidences, including weakness and advantages, in several research areas, such as science,
                education,
                training, physical training, as well as social phenomena, moral behaviors, and could be used in other
                fields,
                like
                travel, meetings, collaboration, industry, news, and entertainment. Furthermore, another review
                published
                this
                year by
                Freeman et al. (2017) focused on VR in mental health, showing the efficacy of VR in assessing and
                treating
                different
                psychological disorders as anxiety, schizophrenia, depression, and eating disorders.

            <p class="first-letter">
                There are many possibilities that allow the use of VR as a stimulus, replacing real stimuli, recreating
                experiences,
                which in the real world would be impossible, with a high realism. This is why VR is widely used in
                research
                on
                new ways
                of applying psychological treatment or training, for example, to problems arising from phobias
                (agoraphobia,
                phobia to
                fly, etc.) (Botella et al., 2017). Or, simply, it is used like improvement of the traditional systems of
                motor
                rehabilitation (Llorens et al., 2014; Borrego et al., 2016), developing games that ameliorate the tasks.
                More in
                detail,
                in psychological treatment, Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has showed its efficacy, allowing to
                patients to
                gradually face fear stimuli or stressed situations in a safe environment where the psychological and
                physiological
                reactions can be controlled by the therapist (Botella et al., 2017).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Milgram and Kishino (1994), conceptualized the Virtual-Reality Continuum that takes into consideration
                four
                systems:
                real environment, augmented reality (AR), augmented virtuality, and virtual environment. AR can be
                defined a
                newer
                technological system in which virtual objects are added to the real world in real-time during the user’s
                experience. Per
                Azuma et al. (2001) an AR system should: (1) combine real and virtual objects in a real environment; (2)
                run
                interactively and in real-time; (3) register real and virtual objects with each other. Furthermore, even
                if
                the
                AR
                experiences could seem different from VRs, the quality of AR experience could be considered similarly.
                Indeed,
                like in
                VR, feeling of presence, level of realism, and the degree of reality represent the main features that
                can be
                considered
                the indicators of the quality of AR experiences. Higher the experience is perceived as realistic, and
                there
                is
                congruence between the user’s expectation and the interaction inside the AR environments, higher would
                be
                the
                perception
                of “being there” physically, and at cognitive and emotional level. The feeling of presence, both in AR
                and
                VR
                environments, is important in acting behaviors like the real ones (Botella et al., 2005; Juan et al.,
                2005;
                Bretón-López
                et al., 2010; Wrzesien et al., 2013).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                Technologically, the AR systems, however various, present three common components, such as a geospatial
                datum
                for the
                virtual object, like a visual marker, a surface to project virtual elements to the user, and an adequate
                processing
                power for graphics, animation, and merging of images, like a pc and a monitor (Carmigniani et al.,
                2011). To
                run, an AR
                system must also include a camera able to track the user movement for merging the virtual objects, and a
                visual
                display,
                like glasses through that the user can see the virtual objects overlaying to the physical world. To
                date,
                two-display
                systems exist, a video see-through (VST) and an optical see-though (OST) AR systems (Botella et al.,
                2005;
                Juan
                et al.,
                2005, 2007). The first one, disclosures virtual objects to the user by capturing the real objects/scenes
                with a
                camera
                and overlaying virtual objects, projecting them on a video or a monitor, while the second one, merges
                the
                virtual object
                on a transparent surface, like glasses, through the user see the added elements. The main difference
                between
                the
                two
                systems is the latency: an OST system could require more time to display the virtual objects than a VST
                system,
                generating a time lag between user’s action and performance and the detection of them by the system.

                Although AR is a more recent technology than VR, it has been investigated and used in several research
                areas
                such as
                architecture (Lin and Hsu, 2017), maintenance (Schwald and De Laval, 2003), entertainment (Ozbek et al.,
                2004),
                education (Nincarean et al., 2013; Bacca et al., 2014; Akçayır and Akçayır, 2017), medicine (De Buck et
                al.,
                2005), and
                psychological treatments (Juan et al., 2005; Botella et al., 2005, 2010; Bretón-López et al., 2010;
                Wrzesien
                et
                al.,
                2011a,b, 2013; see the review Chicchi Giglioli et al., 2015). More in detail, in education several AR
                applications have
                been developed in the last few years showing the positive effects of this technology in supporting
                learning,
                such as an
                increased-on content understanding and memory preservation, as well as on learning motivation (Radu,
                2012,
                2014). For
                example, Ibáñez et al. (2014) developed a AR application on electromagnetism concepts’ learning, in
                which
                students could
                use AR batteries, magnets, cables on real superficies, and the system gave a real-time feedback to
                students
                about the
                correctness of the performance, improving in this way the academic success and motivation (Di Serio et
                al.,
                2013).
                Deeply, AR system allows the possibility to learn visualizing and acting on composite phenomena that
                traditionally
                students study theoretically, without the possibility to see and test in real world (Chien et al., 2010;
                Chen et
                al.,
                2011).
            </p>

            <p class="first-letter">
                As well in psychological health, the number of research about AR is increasing, showing its efficacy
                above
                all
                in the
                treatment of psychological disorder (see the reviews Baus and Bouchard, 2014; Chicchi Giglioli et al.,
                2015).
                For
                example, in the treatment of anxiety disorders, like phobias, AR exposure therapy (ARET) showed its
                efficacy
                in
                one-session treatment, maintaining the positive impact in a follow-up at 1 or 3 month after. As VRET,
                ARET
                provides a
                safety and an ecological environment where any kind of stimulus is possible, allowing to keep control
                over
                the
                situation
                experienced by the patients, gradually generating situations of fear or stress. Indeed, in situations of
                fear,
                like the
                phobias for small animals, AR applications allow, in accordance with the patient’s anxiety, to gradually
                expose
                patient
                to fear animals, adding new animals during the session or enlarging their or increasing the speed. The
                various
                studies
                showed that AR is able, at the beginning of the session, to activate patient’s anxiety, for reducing
                after 1
                h
                of
                exposition. After the session, patients even more than to better manage animal’s fear and anxiety, ware
                able
                to
                approach, interact, and kill real feared animals.

                statistics
                from the Web of Science (WoS), proceedings papers were used extensively as outcomes of research,

                of
                the total
                of 10, 199 articles. However, if we consider only the last 5 years (7,755 articles representing about
                36% of
                the
                total),
                the situation changes with about 57% for articles (4,445) and about 33% for proceedings (2,578). Thus,
                it is
                clear that
                VR field has changed in areas other than at the technological level.

                of
                Science
                “Category” field in all the articles.

                According to the subject category statistics from the WoS, computer science is the leading category,
                followed by
                engineering, and, together, they account for 15,341 articles, which make up about 71% of the total
                production.
                However,
                if we consider just the last 5 years, these categories reach only about 55%, with a total of 4,284
                articles
                (Table 1 and
                Figure 1).

                The evidence is very interesting since it highlights that VR is doing very well as new technology with
                huge
                interest in
                hardware and software components. However, with respect to the past, we are witnessing increasing
                numbers of
                applications, especially in the medical area. In particular, note its inclusion in the top 10 list of
                rehabilitation and
                clinical neurology categories (about 10% of the total production in the last 5 years). It also is
                interesting
                that
                neuroscience and neurology, considered together, have shown an increase from about 12% to about 18.6%
                over
                the
                last 5
                years. However, historic areas, such as automation and control systems, imaging science and photographic
                technology, and
                robotics, which had accounted for about 14.5% of the total articles ever produced were not even in the
                top
                10
                for the
                last 5 years, with each one accounting for less than 4%.

                The countries that were very involved in VR research have published for about 47% of the total (10,200
                articles
                altogether). Of the 10,200 articles, the United States, China, England, and Germany published 4921,
                2384,
                1497,
                and
                1398, respectively. The situation remains the same if we look at the articles published over the last 5
                years.
                However,
                VR contributions also came from all over the globe, with Japan, Canada, Italy, France, Spain, South
                Korea,
                and
                Netherlands taking positions of prominence, as shown in Figure 2.
